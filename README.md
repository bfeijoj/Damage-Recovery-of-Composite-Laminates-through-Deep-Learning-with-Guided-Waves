# Damage Recovery of Composite Laminates through Deep Learning with Guided Waves

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the solution algorithm discussed in the paper titled 'Damage Recovery in Composite Laminates through Deep Learning from Acoustic Scattering of Guided Waves'. Here, we present a comprehensive collection of notebooks that exemplify the methodology proposed in the paper.

## Notebooks and Execution Order

1. ### `compute_dispersion_curves.ipynb`
\
    This notebook calculates dispersion curves for both flawless and flawed composite structures. It aids in selecting optimal guided mode parameters.

2. ### `reconstruct_mode_structure.ipynb`
\
    This notebook computes the guided mode structure of a flawless composite (specular part) using parameters chosen from the dispersion curves analysis.

3. ### `solve_acoustic_scattering_problem.ipynb`
\
    This notebook tackles the direct acoustic scattering problem as an optimization task. It provides a step-by-step approach to solving the direct problem.

4. ### `generate_samples.ipynb`
\
    This notebook generates stochastic defect fields and corresponding scattered guided mode responses from the direct problem's solution.

5. ### `training.ipynb`
\
    This notebook trains a deep learning model (multilayer perceptron) to recover interfacial defect fields.

6. ### `predict.ipynb`
\
    This notebook utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to recover interfacial defect fields from a scattered displacement field response.
